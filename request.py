var = "Mauricio Pochettino is heading towards the point of no return at Tottenham Hotspur as fears grow that he will not be able to salvage their season. The West Ham United game immediately after the international break is now rated as make or break for Tottenham’s campaign, and could even prove decisive for the manager himself. The home draw with Sheffield United last Saturday left Spurs 14th in the Premier League going into the international break, just a point ahead of West Ham and without a win in five league games. Tottenham trail fourth-placed Manchester City by 11 points. West Ham have not won in the league since September, but Spurs have not won away from home in the league since January, when they beat Fulham. Another defeat on the road, at the home of their fierce rivals, would raise serious questions for the Spurs’ manager. Pochettino is understood to have been at Tottenham’s Enfield training centre this week as he attempts to turn around the club’s season. He has already warned there is no quick fix and last Saturday appeared to acknowledge that he may not get the time to make the changes he wants, saying: “We are in the process to build and we will see if we have the time to build what we want.” West Ham and Arsenal have this week put out messages of support for their under-pressure managers, but there has been no such public backing for Pochettino. That could be because Spurs are reluctant to be seen to be giving a dreaded vote of confidence, but the silence has only strengthened theories that a change is becoming inevitable. It could also be a consequence of the fact that Pochettino has given the impression he could eventually walk away after first floating the idea ahead of last season’s Champions League final.  Pochettino signed a five-year contract worth up to £8.5 million a year last May, with sources claiming it would cost chairman Daniel Levy around £12.5 million to sack him. Spurs have never confirmed the details of Pochettino’s contract, but Levy would prefer not to pay an expensive compensation bill to sack a manager who has done so much for the club. There is also the issue over who would replace Pochettino midseason, even in a caretaker position, with no obvious interim at the club. That would enhance the prospects of an out-of-work manager, such as Max Allegri or Jose Mourinho, being approached. But waiting to the end of the season would widen Levy’s options and give him a more realistic chance of appointing Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann, or even England manager Gareth Southgate. Pochettino will have no shortage of suitors when he eventually leaves. He is still rated as one of the best in the business and has admirers at Manchester United and Real Madrid. The 47-year-old has worked sporting miracles since being appointed in 2014, taking the club into the Champions League and reaching the final, as well as competing for the Premier League title. Pochettino wanted to make big changes this summer, but Tottenham failed to sell the likes of Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose, while making only three new signings. Eriksen has denied that he has been dropped as punishment for not signing a new contract, saying: “I feel 100 per cent that Tottenham has complete confidence in me. There is not that big a difference, except that I play a little less this year.“‘I don’t feel there is a connection between my contract situation and the fact that I haven’t played as many matches.”"
